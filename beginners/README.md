# Beginners Hands-On Lab

## Prerequisites
The required Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) resources must be provisioned.  See the [Terraform documentation](./terraform/README.md) for more information on how to do this.

## Getting Started
The first labs are numbered and intended to progress through them in numerical order.  First data will be collected from some public data sources, then you'll dive into analyzing the data.

## Prerequisites

You must execute the scripts "install_beginner_env.sh" to deploy all python libraries necessary for the Beginner HOL.
